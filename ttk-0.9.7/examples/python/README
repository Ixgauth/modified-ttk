Minimalist python TTK example pipeline, including:
-# The computation of a persistence curve
-# The computation of a persistence diagram
-# The selection of the most persistent pairs of the diagram
-# The pre-simplification of the data according to this selection
-# The computation of the Morse-Smale complex on this simplified data
-# The storage of the output of this pipeline to disk.

This example reproduces the Figure 1 of the TTK companion paper:
"The Topology ToolKit", 
J. Tierny, G. Favelier, J. Levine, C. Gueunet, M. Michaux.,
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,
Proc. of IEEE VIS 2017.


To run this example, first install TTK on your system 
(https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html).

Then, from the current directory, enter the following command (omit the '$'
character):
$ ./ttkExample-python.py ../data/inputData.vtu
